 ## Objective: 
   Create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds Docker images and uploads them to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) upon code pushes or pull requests.
 ## Basic Pre-requesites:
 * Clone Git repository of Sample Code
 * Create Sonar Server for Code Qulity check
## 1. GitHub Repository Setup

  This is the repo this we are going to use to execute the build and create the images for it.
- Clone this Java based sample application repository
  Here can see that it has only Src code and its pom.xml file which are important to execute build for this application.
